    <h1>Akan Name Generator</h1>
    <p>An Akan name refers to a name from the Akan people, a group native to West Africa, particularly Ghana and CÃ´te d'Ivoire. The Akan people have a rich naming tradition, and their names often carry deep cultural significance, reflecting the circumstances surrounding a person's birth, their position in the family, or the day of the week they were born.</p>

     <p>The Akan naming system is heavily influenced by the day of the week on which a person is born. Each day of the week has corresponding male and female names, which are commonly used among the Akan-speaking people. These names are typically given by the parents or elders within the family.</p>
